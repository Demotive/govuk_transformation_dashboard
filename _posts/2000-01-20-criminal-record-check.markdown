    Following the discovery phase, GDS and Home Office have agreed that due to contractual constraints and competing policy and legislative priorities, there would be more opportunity to effect transformational change by March 2015 in another service. GDS and Home Office have agreed to investigate working with HM Passport Office as an alternative to this exemplar. A discovery phase is now underway with HM Passports Office.
