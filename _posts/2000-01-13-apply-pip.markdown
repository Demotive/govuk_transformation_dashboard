scope-of-exemplar: |
    Personal Independence Payment (PIP) was introduced in April 2013 for people aged 16 to 64 to help with the extra costs of long-term ill-health or disability. Users can make a claim over the telephone or through the post and may need to attend a face-to-face consultation with a health professional to assess how much support they need.

    We’re now building an in-depth understanding of user needs to see which parts of the PIP process might best be delivered through digital channels.
