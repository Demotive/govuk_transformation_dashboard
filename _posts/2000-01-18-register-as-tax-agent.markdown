homepage-intro: |
    If you are the tax agent for another company or individual you will be able to do everything they can with the new digital tax services on their behalf (update details, file returns, etc)

detail-page-intro: |
    An easy to use online tax dashboard for 120,000 tax agents


digital-strategy-statement: |
    ...making registering to act as an agent easier and quicker... agents will have the tools to take more control of their clients’ tax affairs and undertake transactions for them with minimal involvement from HMRC... any new IT services developed for individual customers should be available to agents.

scope-of-exemplar: |
    The tax exemplars will provide digital PAYE services for people in employment (benefits in kind), a fully digital self assessment service, improved tools and tax dashboard for small businesses, and a new system for tax agents to use online services. These will be built on a new “digital tax platform” which will over time replace the current HMRC Portal and be the default platform for new customer-facing services. The new tax platform will be fully integrated with the pan-government ID Assurance Programme and with GOV.UK.
