headline-title: Digital Transformation

headline-subtitle: We’re transforming government by building digital services that are simpler, clearer and faster to use. We’re starting with 25 exemplar services. You can follow our progress here.

intro: |
    We’re redesigning and rebuilding 25 major government services, which we call exemplars, to make them simpler, clearer and faster to use.

    This dashboard lets you follow our progress. You can see which services are in the transformation programme, the scale of those services, and the stage of development they’re at.

    The exemplars should meet the [Digital By Default Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default) by April 2014, and go live by March 2015.

    You can read more about the transformation programme on the [transformation blog](https://digitaltransformation.blog.gov.uk/).
